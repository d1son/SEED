# SEED (Student Employee Employer Database)

##General Project Summary

Our project will use multiple APIs (listed below) in order to provide empolyees with potential employers and vice versa. We're going to use firebase to store student information (employees) so that everyone (employers) can click on a specific person to view more information about them (github, LinkedIn, etc.).
