# SEED (Student Employee Employer Database)

##General Project Summary

Our project will use multiple APIs (listed below) in order to provide employees with potential employers and vice versa. We're going to use firebase to store student information (employees) so that everyone (employers) can click on a specific person to view more information about them (github, LinkedIn, etc.). Add filtering options so members can search by certain criteria such as location, job specifications, salary, etc.

S.E.E.D (Student Employee Employer Database) is a website designed to connect students and employees with potential employers by using a uniquely created profile which students and employees seeking employment can utilize to match to a potential employer with ease. All you need to do is click on the "Student/Employee" section, add the links and information you want, ex: LinkedIn profile, Facebook, Twitter, Github etc., and click "Add Student" which then simultaneously stores your information to our FireBase Database while creating a profile card that you can showcase to potential employers. You can easily choose your skills and expertise by using a list of checkboxes, which employers can later use to filter through candidates for a specific job needing a particular expertise or skill that you may have.
